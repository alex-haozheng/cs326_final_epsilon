# Overview
Why UDine? You dine because UMASS Dining is a world class college dining experience with a diverse selection of menu items from all around the globe. A world class dining experience requires a world class website, and that is what UDine seeks to provide  current, former, and prospective students of UMASS Amherst. Unlike the official UMASS dining website, UDine allows students to more easily decide where and what they want to eat. Searching a specific menu items will show where that item can be found on campus. Users can filter out items that are not "vegetarian," "whole grain," or "halal." Additionally, users can also find the unique daily items for each of the four dining halls in order to more easily isolate the "daily specials" from regularly recurring menu items. Finally, users can create a profile and add their favorite items to a list, to quickly access these later. We hope that this website will enable our users to have a more unique dining experience in which they can fully appreciate the range of options that UMASS dining has to offer.
